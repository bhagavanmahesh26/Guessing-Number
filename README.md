# Guessing-Number
The Number Guessing Game is a simple Java-based game where players must guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides hints (“Too High” or “Too Low”) and has a limited number of attempts to guess correctly. It can be implemented as a console-based game or an interactive GUI using Java Swing.
